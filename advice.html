        <h3>How to word your question</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Allow the cards to guide you</h4>
                <h5>Tarot is about letting the cards guide you to the answer you are seeking. You may already know the answer, or you may need some direction. In either case, it is not up to the cards to answer questions for you. They are here to help you come to your own conclusions.</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Find a happy medium in specificity</h4>
                <h5>The best questions for tarot are those that are about a specific subject, but still open for interpretation. Avoid questions with yes or no answers. If you are not sure what to ask, a good fall-back is "do you have any messages for me today?"</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>It's all about you</h4>
                <h5>This is one time that it is good to be a little selfish! Ask questions about yourself. The question might involve other people, such as if you are asking about a situation involving someone specific, but avoid asking directly about anyone but yourself. If someone else wants a reading, they should ask a question and pull their own cards.</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Keep an open mind</h4>
                <h5>Cards mean different things to different people, and also relate to each other in intricate ways. The plain-text description of each card is a baseline to work from, but allow yourself to be open to your own intuition. Sometimes the cards' images tell a story that has nothing to do with the accepted interpretations of each individual card. You may also find that you begin to associate certain cards with specific things. The meaning may not even be obvious at first. It is a good idea to keep track of past readings to look back on and see if you find any new meaning after some time has passed.</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Think positively</h4>
                <h5>Some cards may seem like they are all doom and gloom, especially in their reversed positions, but remember: this is your reading, and the cards are meant to guide you, not tell you exactly how things are or will be.</h5>
            </li>
        </ul>
