## MVP:

- Cards (78 in a deck) are randomly generated each time page is reloaded
- CSS to make the page look nice
- Appropriate image displayed for each card

## Post-MVP:
- Responsive design with at least 2 media queries
- Cards start with backs up, flip when user clicks them
- Card flip animation
- Full RWS description of card, not just meanings
- Add reverse-meanings (doubles total cards)
- Add "library" of cards user can look through
- Add search bar so user can search for a specific card
- Use local storage to store readings
