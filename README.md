# Techwitch-Tarot

#### Note: first commits were directly through github as I edited README.md. First commit via git (with the specific git commit statement) was actually the 12th commit.

## App Description:
#### An online tarot reader. Users can open the page and be provided with a basic 3-card spread with associated card meanings.

## API: 
<https://rws-cards-api.herokuapp.com/>

## MVP: - DONE
- Use RWS Tarot API to generate random tarot cards - DONE
- HTML page with 3 cards displayed and meanings underneath - DONE
- Cards (78 in a deck) are randomly generated each time page is reloaded - DONE
- CSS to make the page look nice - DONE
- Appropriate image displayed for each card - DONE
- Responsive design with at least 2 media queries - DONE

## Post-MVP:
- Cards start with backs up, flip when user clicks them - DONE
- Card flip animation - DONE
- Make sure cards can't repeat - DONE
- Full RWS description of card, not just meanings - DONE
- Add reverse-meanings (doubles total cards)
- Add "library" of cards user can look through - DONE
- Add search bar so user can search for a specific card
- Use local storage to store readings
- Move card info to display layered on top of flipped cards instead of underneath
- Make JS DRYer so I don't have the same code repeated for each card
- Add "advice" page to help people understand tarot
