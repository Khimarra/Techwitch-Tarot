# Techwitch-Tarot

#### Note: first commits were directly through github as I edited README.md. First commit via git (with the specific git commit statement) was actually the 12th commit.

## App Description:
#### An online tarot reader. Users can open the page and be provided with a basic 3-card spread with associated card meanings.

## API: 
<https://rws-cards-api.herokuapp.com/>

## API Snippet:

## Wireframes:

## MVP:
- Use RWS Tarot API to generate random tarot cards
- HTML page with 3 cards displayed and meanings underneath
- Cards (78 in a deck) are randomly generated each time page is reloaded
- CSS to make the page look nice
- Appropriate image displayed for each card
- Responsive design with at least 2 media queries

## Post-MVP:
- Cards start with backs up, flip when user clicks them
- Card flip animation
- Full RWS description of card, not just meanings
- Add reverse-meanings (doubles total cards)
- Add "library" of cards user can look through
- Add search bar so user can search for a specific card
- Use local storage to store readings
